# ML-Fundamentals

A hands-on approach to learning Machine Learning fundamentals through daily practice and implementation. This repository documents my progress building expertise in essential ML libraries and core concepts.

## About

3rd-year Software Engineering student learning ML foundations through practical coding. Building from NumPy basics to advanced ML algorithms.

## Learning Path

This repository covers the core libraries and concepts needed for Machine Learning:

| Module | Status | Focus Areas |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 01 - NumPy | Completed | Array operations, broadcasting, vectorization, linear algebra |
| 02 - Pandas | Completed | DataFrames, data manipulation, cleaning, aggregation, merging |
| 03 - Matplotlib | Planned | Data visualization, plotting, customization |
| More modules | Coming Soon 

## Repository Structure

Each module is organized with daily practice files:

```
ML-Fundamentals/
├── 01-Numpy/
│   ├── README.md       # Topics covered + daily breakdown
│   ├── day1.py
│   ├── day2.py
│   └── ...
├── 02-Pandas/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── day1.py
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## What You'll Find Here
