## 📚 Learning Path

This repository covers the core libraries and concepts needed for Machine Learning:

| Module | Status | Focus Areas |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 01 - NumPy | ✅ Completed | Array operations, broadcasting, vectorization, linear algebra |
| 02 - Pandas | 🔄 In Progress | DataFrames, data manipulation, cleaning, aggregation, merging |
| 03 - Matplotlib | 📅 Planned | Data visualization, plotting, customization |
| 04 - Scikit-learn | 📅 Planned | ML algorithms, model training, evaluation, preprocessing |
| More modules | 📅 Coming Soon | Deep Learning frameworks, advanced topics |

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each module is organized with daily practice files:
